## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the code for **“Uncertainty Modeling in Graph Neural Networks via Stochastic Differential Equations”**, published at ICLR 2025. We introduce **Latent Graph Neural SDEs (LGNSDEs)**, a novel framework that

- Combines **Graph Neural Networks** with **Stochastic Differential Equations** to learn uncertainty-aware node embeddings.
- Quantifies both **aleatoric** (data) and **epistemic** (model) uncertainty via a Bayesian prior–posterior SDE in latent space.
- Provides **theoretical guarantees** on well-posedness, variance bounds, and robustness to input perturbations.
